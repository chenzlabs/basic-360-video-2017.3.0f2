Basic 360 video example with Unity 2017.3.0f2

A basic Sphere is used as the video playback surface.
It applies the ReverseNormals script so that the texture is visible on the *inside* of the sphere.
In order for the video to look right, instead of using the default material,
a Material configured to use the Unlit/Texture shader is applied.

This example uses the built-in Unity supported Video Player, in material override mode.
The 360 video URL is the same one used in the A-Frame 360 video example at http://aframe-360-video-example.glitch.me/

Enjoy!
